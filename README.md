To-do-Web App

A web app that used to maintain our day-day activities or tasks so that we don't forgot some important tasks to do. Web app is created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. User can add as many as tasks,once completed he can tick task as completed or even delete the task. In this project I have used Google local storage to store data ,so even when a page is refreshed user still access the page.
